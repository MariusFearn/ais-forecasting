# Project Structure Evaluation & Cleanup

## 🔍 **Current Status Assessment**

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. **Data Location Inconsistency** - RESOLVED
   - ✅ Moved all data from `raw_data/` to `data/raw/`
   - ✅ Removed duplicate `raw_data/` directory
   - ✅ Updated `data/raw/README.md` with actual file descriptions

## 📊 **Phase Completion Status**

### Phase 1: Data Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] H3 library setup
- [x] Data exploration (vessel_exploration.ipynb)
- [x] Resolution testing (Resolution 5 chosen)
- [x] Basic vessel tracking (VesselH3Tracker)

### Phase 2: Individual Vessel Features ✅ COMPLETE  
- [x] 65 vessel-specific features implemented
- [x] VesselFeatureExtractor class
- [x] Sample data processing (vessel_features_sample.pkl)
- [x] Comprehensive feature documentation

### Phase 3: Multi-Vessel Patterns 🟡 PLANNED
- [ ] Fleet-level aggregation features
- [ ] TFT & N-BEATS model training
- [ ] Evaluation pipeline
- [ ] Interactive dashboards

## 🛠 **Structure Recommendations for Phase 3**

### Option 1: Keep Current Structure ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Pros:**
- Clean, standard ML project layout
- All phases build incrementally
- No folder proliferation
- Easy navigation

**Changes needed:**
- None - structure is optimal

### Option 2: Phase-Specific Folders (NOT RECOMMENDED)
```
├── phase1_data_foundation/
├── phase2_vessel_features/  
├── phase3_fleet_patterns/
```
**Cons:**
- Creates unnecessary duplication
- Breaks standard ML conventions
- Makes code imports complex
- Harder to maintain

## 📋 **Pre-Phase 3 Checklist**

### ✅ **Structure Ready:**
- [x] Data properly organized in `data/raw/`
- [x] Feature extraction pipeline in `src/features/`
- [x] Model architectures in `src/models/`
- [x] Configuration system in `config/`
- [x] Documentation up to date

### 🔧 **Minor Enhancements Needed:**

1. **Add Phase 3 subdirectories in data/processed:**
   ```
   data/processed/
   ├── vessel_features/           # Phase 2 outputs
   ├── fleet_features/            # Phase 3 aggregated features
   ├── training_sets/             # Model training data
   └── predictions/               # Model outputs
   ```

2. **Add experiment tracking:**
   ```
   experiments/
   ├── tft_experiments/
   ├── nbeats_experiments/
   └── baseline_experiments/
   ```

3. **Add model artifacts storage:**
   ```
   data/models/
   ├── checkpoints/
   ├── final_models/
   └── hyperparameter_logs/
   ```

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**KEEP CURRENT STRUCTURE** - it's excellent and follows ML best practices.

**Minor additions needed:**
1. Create subdirectories in `data/processed/` for Phase 3 outputs
2. Add `experiments/` folder for model tracking
3. Organize `data/models/` with subdirectories

The current structure is clean, professional, and scalable. No major restructuring needed - just add the specific subdirectories for Phase 3 deliverables.

## 🚀 **Ready for Phase 3**

Your project structure is **production-ready** and follows industry standards. The Phase 2 completion with 65 features provides an excellent foundation for Phase 3 multi-vessel pattern recognition.

**Proceed with Phase 3 implementation using current structure.**
