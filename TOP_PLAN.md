# Deep Learning Forecasting Project - Restructuring Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for restructuring our deep learning forecasting project that works with AIS data to predict maritime metrics. After analyzing the previous implementation, we've identified several areas for improvement in code organization, model architecture, data processing, and overall project management.

## Project Structure

We will adopt a modular, maintainable structure following best practices for ML projects:

## Key Components

### 1. Data Management

#### Data Pipeline
- **Raw Data Collection**: Standardized process for ingesting AIS data
- **Preprocessing**: Reusable preprocessing functions for:
  - H3 geospatial binning with consistent resolution handling
  - Vessel filtering and data validation
  - Missing data imputation strategies
  - Feature normalization and standardization
- **Data Versioning**: Clear tracking of datasets used for each experiment

#### Features
- **Geospatial Features**: Advanced H3-based features with proper validation
- **Time-Series Features**: Calendar features, rolling statistics, lag features
- **Feature Selection**: Systematic approach to identify most predictive features

### 2. Modeling

#### Architecture
- **Base Model Interface**: Common interface for all model implementations
- **Model Implementations**:
  - Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
  - N-BEATS
  - Potential new architectures (DeepAR, Informer)
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with inheritance

#### Training
- **Training Loop**: Standardized training with proper validation
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Systematic approach using Optuna
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logging metrics, parameters, and artifacts
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting with appropriate patience
- **Model Checkpointing**: Save best models based on validation metrics

### 3. Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Comprehensive set of evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, SMAPE, QuantileLoss)
- **Visualization**: Standard visualizations for model performance
- **Interpretability**: Model-specific interpretation methods
- **Backtesting**: Proper time-series cross-validation

### 4. Deployment

- **Model Serialization**: Standardized approach to save and load models
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Clean interface for generating forecasts
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance over time
- **Retraining Strategy**: Plan for periodic model updates

## Why This Approach Is Better

### 1. Modularity and Reusability
- **Previous Issue**: Code was monolithic with many hardcoded parameters
- **Improvement**: Modularized components with clear interfaces allow for reuse and easier maintenance

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Previous Issue**: Parameters scattered throughout code, making experiments hard to reproduce
- **Improvement**: Centralized configuration with inheritance for experiment tracking

### 3. Data Pipeline Robustness
- **Previous Issue**: Fragile data preprocessing with inconsistent handling of edge cases
- **Improvement**: Robust pipeline with proper validation and error handling

### 4. Model Development
- **Previous Issue**: Ad-hoc model development with inconsistent training procedures
- **Improvement**: Standardized model interface and training loop with proper validation

### 5. Evaluation Framework
- **Previous Issue**: Limited evaluation metrics and visualization
- **Improvement**: Comprehensive evaluation framework with proper time-series cross-validation

### 6. Documentation and Testing
- **Previous Issue**: Limited documentation and no automated testing
- **Improvement**: Comprehensive documentation and automated testing for critical components

### 7. Experiment Tracking
- **Previous Issue**: No systematic way to track experiments and their results
- **Improvement**: Proper logging of metrics, parameters, and artifacts

## Considerations for Further Development

1. **Data Drift Monitoring**: Implement systems to detect when model inputs deviate from training data
2. **Online Learning**: Consider approaches for incremental model updates
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Explore combining different model architectures
4. **Hardware Requirements**: Optimize for available GPU/CPU resources
5. **Explainability**: Enhance model interpretability for business stakeholders
6. **Integration**: Plan for integration with existing systems

## Lessons Learned from Previous Implementation

1. **Overengineering**: The previous approach tried to do too much at once without proper abstraction
2. **Data Quality**: Insufficient attention to data validation and cleaning led to unstable models
3. **Model Complexity**: Using complex models without proper understanding of their capabilities
4. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Ad-hoc selection without systematic optimization
5. **Validation Strategy**: Improper validation led to overestimated performance metrics
6. **Feature Importance**: Lack of understanding which features drive predictions

By addressing these issues with our new approach, we expect to achieve:
- More accurate and stable forecasts
- Faster experimentation cycle
- Better understanding of model behavior
- Easier maintenance and extension of the codebase
- Reproducible research and development process

## Success Metrics

We will measure the success of our restructuring by:
1. Reduction in RMSE and MAE on validation data by at least 15%
2. Decrease in training time by at least 20%
3. Ability to deploy models with consistent performance
4. Time saved during experimentation and model iteration
5. Code quality metrics (test coverage, documentation)

## Conclusion

This restructuring will transform our current ad-hoc approach into a robust, maintainable forecasting system. By properly implementing software engineering best practices for machine learning projects, we'll be able to more rapidly iterate on models while maintaining high code quality and reproducibility.
